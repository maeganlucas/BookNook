Book Nook is a book review application for the use of both authors and readers that interacts with a database to store all information. Users create accounts based on whether they are an author or a reader, which will determine the functionalities available to them. 

Authors are able enter their books into the Book Nook database. From there, as readers write reviews for their books, authors are able to view rating breakdowns for each of their books. No reader information is shared to the author within these breakdowns. Authors can update or delete books in the database at anytime.

Readers are able to search books already entered into the database. Once they have selected the book they are searching for, they can select, edit, or delete a reading status. Once a reader marks a book as read, the reader can then review the book based on different categories. These reviews can be edited or deleted at anytime.

Both types of user can update or delete their profiles at anytime. For author users, any book already entered into the database will remain in the database after the account is deleted.
